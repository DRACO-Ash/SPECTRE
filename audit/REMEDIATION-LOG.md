# SPECTRE remediation log

Running record of fixes made against `audit/FINDINGS.md`, in the sequence set by `audit/REMEDIATION.md`. The audit artefacts themselves describe the tree at `a34e273` and are not rewritten. This log is the delta.

**Method, for every row.** Every row followed the same five steps:
1. A test reproducing the defect was written first and seen to fail.
2. The fix was applied.
3. The new test passed.
4. ruff and mypy strict on `spectre/` were clean, and the full suite was green.
5. The change was committed on its own.

The "Gate" column names the test that now fails if the defect returns.

## Step 1: Blockers (8 of 8 closed)

| Finding | Origin | Commit | Defect, as reproduced before the fix | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F-008 | F-S08-01 | `36c93ae` | 10 wrong passwords, then the correct one: 302 with a session cookie | `tests/integration/test_login_hardening.py::TestFailedLoginRateLimit::test_a_locked_account_refuses_even_the_correct_password` |
| F-007 | F-S06-01 | `c369ee9` | a 48 h coast produced a 48-day GEO drift | `tests/unit/test_maneuver_route_units.py` (3 tests) |
| F-005 | F-S02-03 | `bbc9722` | drift +18.85 km/orbit where the CW solution gives -37.70 | `tests/unit/test_relative_motion_stability.py::TestSecularDrift` (4 cases, rel 1e-9 against `_cw_propagate`) |
| F-006 | F-S02-04 | `bbc9722` | a bounded 2:1 relative orbit scored below 100 | `tests/unit/test_relative_motion_stability.py::TestStabilityInterceptFrame` |
| F-001 | F-S01-01 | `e361b93` | a 0.1 deg trim priced at 754.3 m/s instead of 13.2 m/s | `tests/unit/test_manoeuvre_detect_units.py`; the static guard in `tests/unit/test_orbital_units_and_degeneracies.py` now matches any `<alias>.degrees(` across `spectre/` and was shown to fail on the original lines |
| F-002 | F-S01-02 | `42d42a6` | 0.0000 km/s to align planes 8 deg apart; the burn was 866 km off the target plane | `tests/unit/test_plane_change_intercept.py` (2 tests) |
| F-003 | F-S01-03 | `5398c10` | 14.64 km/s departure for a 10 deg hop at 98 deg and 135 deg inclination | `tests/unit/test_lambert_direction.py` (4 tests); the Curtis Ex. 5.2 suite is unchanged and passes |
| F-004 | F-S02-01 | `2e5cbda` | cheaper than Hohmann; the arc missed the target by 5,157 km; an impossible budget was answered | `tests/unit/test_min_time_intercept.py` (4 tests) |

Also closed in passing, because the fix touched the same lines:
● **F-S01-13** (Medium): the `solve_lambert` docstring no longer credits Izzo, in `5398c10`.
● The `prograde (short-way)` docstring error cited inside F-003, in `5398c10`.

**Behaviour changes an operator will see, inference:**
● Plane-change plans now depart at the next crossing of the target plane, not immediately.
● Minimum-time intercepts are two-burn Lambert plans, and are refused rather than answered when no single-revolution transfer fits the budget.
● Retrograde-orbit Lambert costs drop from about 15 km/s to realistic values.
● Manoeuvre detection stops classifying TLE noise as plane changes.

Suite after step 1: 1,913 passed, 2 skipped, 0 failed (from 1,896 and 2 at audit).
